# PetreOrdinaryLeastSquares

I wrote this project in Jupyter Notebook, with the help of miniconda (a software where i organise all my projects and, in the same time, a useful tool to acces and install various libraries).

This project is a presentation about the Least Square Method, in order to demonstrate how good is this method in order to build the linear regression of an given set of data.
